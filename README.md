# visualization-2imv10
Visualization project - 2IMV20 - 2020/2021

## How to run this project?
To use this visualisation, you should install Python 3.
Then, open a terminal (or Windows Powershell) in this repository folder and run the command `python -m http.server` to start a local development server.
After the server has started, you can browse to localhost:8000 to view the visualisation. If you cannot get it to run for some reason, we also provide a website to try it out: https://staartvin.github.io/visualization-2imv10/

## How to import files?
We have provided four different datasets that you can use to play with the visualizer.
